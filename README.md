Playing around with CSS Custom Properties

## Conclusions
I will mainly write down the pros versus the preprocessors

1. Great, you can see all the variables in the browser(Chrome) inspector and play with the values.

2. Variables are properties -> Neat, because this can be modified(get and set) by javascript
